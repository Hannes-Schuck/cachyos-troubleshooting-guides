# CachyOS troubleshooting guides

This repository contains guides/cheatsheets about my **personal** experience with CachyOS.

To prevent having to figure out this problems again, I created this repository to share my "wisdom". I do not guarantee that these guides work as intended and may break your system. Be careful and inform yourself before using random commands from the internet!

Following guides are available:
- [How I setup secure boot](setup-secure-boot.md)
- [How I setup hibernation](use-hibernation.md)
- [How I fixed my broken dual boot bootloader](fix-broken-bootloader.md)
