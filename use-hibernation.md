# Enable Hibernation on CachyOS

To enable hibernation I used this [guide](https://meganerd.nl/blog/enable-hibernation-in-cachyos-alongside-zram-swap-with-full-disk-encryption-on-btrfs).
Yes that's my advice... but I can also say that when using the KDE Plasma fullscreen application starter there is **no** hibernation button displayed. Use the default starter.
