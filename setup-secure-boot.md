# Setup Secure Boot

The official CachyOS wiki has an [article](https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/secure_boot_setup/) about Secure Boot which I followed and which worked. I recommend using this guide.

When using Secure Boot I get following warning which I will be looking into soon:

```
Firmware:       ‼ Your firmware has known quirks
                - FQ0001: Defaults to executing on Secure Boot policy violation (CRITICAL)
                  https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl/wiki/FQ0001
